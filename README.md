# machine-learning-basics
Getting started with ML with some simple projects with the aim to progress towards deep RL. Starting with the guidance from [Spinning Up as a Deep RL Researcher](#learning-resources) by [Joshua Achiam](https://jachiam.github.io/about).

## Progression
- [ ] Step 1 - *[feel pretty confident in implementing a simple program to do supervised learning](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html#the-right-background:~:text=feel%20pretty%20confident%20in%20implementing%20a%20simple%20program%20to%20do%20supervised%20learning)*

- [x] Step 2 - *[Get comfortable with the main concepts and terminology in RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html#the-right-background:~:text=Get%20comfortable%20with%20the%20main%20concepts%20and%20terminology%20in%20RL)*

  Learned the basics (*and more*) from the first three courses of the [Reinforcement Learning Specialization](#learning-resources). Still, worth a revision.

- [ ] Step 3 - *[Learn by Doing](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html#learn-by-doing)*
